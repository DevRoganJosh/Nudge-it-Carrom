# Nudge it Carrom
 A very basic and free hit game!
This Game is designed in 3 days because of my ongoing end semester exams, considering the limited time and assets I have focused mainly on the completion of the tasks provided to me.

Making of Nudge It Carrom :
I always like to work with the process of documenting the things, as this project was short so I made handwritten notes and kept updating it. The game is based on the Hot topic of Human vs AI. Where the player i.e you have to face an AI named Crrom GPT.

Tasks and solutions :
The game is a single player and can be played on any mobile devices! UI will be scalled according to the the device.
Mechanics : Usually when we play a carrom game we see mostly same type of controls present in every carrom game. Considering this fact I had made other way of controlling the striker. As mentioned the striker can be dragged behind for the force. Force can be applied only when the striker changes its Y pos.
Physics : All the components of the game follow physics!
Boundaries : Bouncing off the boundaries was implemented while keeping in mind the friction and total force applied to the bodies.
Scoring : To keep the game simple I didn't implement foul striker. Game is only of 2 minutes so creating more rules can ruin the experience and hence only implemeted a short timer to avoid wastage of time. Regular pucks give 1 point, Queen goes for 2 points while short timer running off deducts a point from player's score.
Timer : implemented after I was done with the core mechanics and gameplay.
AI : AI was created just after the player controller. the simplest AI which doesn't even require any AI header file. It just randomly strikes any puck. but with random force which can be brutal for the Player :)

At last I just wanna conmclude that I enjoy making even simples games on the theme or possibly with a story, making it more intresting and intense! The scripts and the controller that I had set up is purely mine. You can even check for plagiarism!
The UI is obviously not upto the mark but for the mechanics I gave my best.

Thank you!
